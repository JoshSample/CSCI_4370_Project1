# CSCI_4370_Project1
This repo has an implementation of the Naive Bayes classification algortithm, with a testing and training set on wine data trying to predict if wine will score a 90+ or 90-. A folder, "Part3", contains files used/produced by SVM Light. <br/><br/>
A follow-up to this project, in the "Project1FollowUp" folder, contains an implementation of k-fold cross validation, with k=5, for providing accuracy measures for our algorithm.
